# 👋 Hi, I’m Nitharshan CK

I’m a Computer Science student who focuses on **fundamentals**, **system behavior**,  
and **clear, explainable reasoning**.

This GitHub isn’t a highlight reel.  
It’s a workspace — where ideas are tested, broken, debugged, and refined until both  
the **code** and the **thinking behind it** make sense.

---

## 🧭 What This GitHub Represents

You’ll find work that reflects:
- Learning through **implementation and iteration**
- Moving from *“it works”* → *“I know why it works”*
- Revisiting solutions when assumptions feel weak
- Using code as a way to **reason about systems**, not just produce output

Most repositories here evolved through questions, failed attempts, and refinement.

---

## ⚙️ What I Work Close To

I spend most of my time thinking about **how programs behave at runtime**, including:
- How processes are created, scheduled, and terminated
- How user-level code interacts with system-level abstractions
- How applications communicate reliably over a network
- How design choices affect performance, correctness, and failure modes

Rather than treating these as isolated ideas, I try to understand how they connect
and influence each other in real systems.

## 🧠 How I Approach Problems

My usual workflow:
1. Understand the problem and constraints clearly  
2. Build a minimal, correct solution  
3. Test edge cases and challenge assumptions  
4. Fix **logic**, not symptoms  
5. Refine until behavior and explanation align  

If I can’t explain a solution cleanly, I don’t consider it finished.

## 📐 Reasoning, Algorithms & Models

- Recursive problem solving with clear base and recursive cases
- Greedy strategies with correctness reasoning
- Graph-based representations and traversal logic
- Conceptual understanding of representation learning and attention mechanisms

The focus is always on **why an approach works**, not just how to implement it.

---

## 🛠️ Tools I Use (When They Make Sense)

I use tools to **solve problems clearly**, not to inflate a stack.

**Languages**
- C · Java · Python  
- Haskell (functional reasoning, pattern matching)  
- Bash / Shell scripting  

**Environment & Tools**
- Linux (command-line driven workflow)
- Git & GitHub
- MATLAB (mathematical and statistical computation)

---

## 📂 What You’ll Find in These Repositories

- Code that prioritizes **clarity and correctness**
- Notes written to replace memorization with understanding
- Projects that show learning progression, not just final outcomes
- Clear separation between **concept**, **implementation**, and **results**

---

## 👀 For Recruiters & Reviewers

If you’re looking for someone who:
- Is comfortable reasoning about **program behavior and systems**
- Learns independently and improves through iteration
- Writes careful, explainable code
- Values fundamentals over shortcuts

this GitHub should give you a reliable signal.
