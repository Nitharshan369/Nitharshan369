# Hi, I’m Nitharshan

I’m a Computer Science student who focuses on **fundamentals, system behavior,
and clear reasoning**.

This GitHub is not a showcase of finished products. It’s a record of how I learn:
by building, breaking, debugging, and refining until both the code and the
explanation make sense.

---

## What This GitHub Represents

This space documents:
- Learning through **implementation and iteration**
- Moving from *“it works”* to *“I understand why it works”*
- Revisiting solutions when logic or assumptions feel weak
- Using code as a way to reason about systems, not just produce output

Most repositories here evolved through questioning, failed attempts, and
incremental improvement.

---

## What I Work Close To

I spend most of my time thinking about how programs actually behave at runtime:
- How processes are created, scheduled, and terminated
- How user-level code interacts with system-level abstractions
- How applications communicate reliably over a network
- How design choices affect performance, correctness, and failure modes

Rather than treating these as isolated topics, I try to understand how they
connect and influence each other in real systems.

## How I Approach Problems

My workflow usually looks like this:
1. Understand the problem and constraints clearly
2. Build a minimal correct solution
3. Test edge cases and break assumptions
4. Fix logic, not symptoms
5. Refine until behavior and explanation align

If I can’t explain a solution cleanly, I don’t consider it finished.

## Algorithms, Reasoning, and Models

- Recursive problem solving with clear base and recursive cases
- Greedy strategies with correctness reasoning
- Graph-based representations and traversal logic
- Conceptual understanding of representation learning and attention mechanisms

The focus is always on **why an approach works**, not just how to implement it.

---

## Tools I Use (When They Make Sense)

I use tools to **solve problems clearly**, not to inflate a stack.

**Languages**
- C
- Java
- Python
- Haskell
- Bash / Shell scripting

**Environment & Tools**
- Linux (command-line driven workflow)
- Git & GitHub
- MATLAB (mathematical and statistical computation)

---

## What You’ll Find in These Repositories

- Code that prioritizes **clarity and correctness**
- Notes written to replace memorization with understanding
- Projects that show learning progression, not just final outcomes
- Clear separation between **concept**, **implementation**, and **results**

---

## For Recruiters and Reviewers

If you’re looking for someone who:
- Is comfortable reasoning about **program behavior and systems**
- Learns independently and improves through iteration
- Writes careful, explainable code
- Values fundamentals over shortcuts

this GitHub should give you a reliable signal.

*This repository reflects how I think and learn, not just the tools I use.*
